This is a transliteration of a lambda-calculus evaluator in continuation-passing style,
with a "fuel" counter so that the interpreted term can be preempted.

It's incredibly simplistic, inefficient, and nearly untested.
However, it could act as an initial guide for transliterating more sophisticated analogous things.
